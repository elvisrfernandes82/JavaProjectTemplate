########################### Elvis Fernandes Assignment 1 - Fully Automatic Beverage Vending Machine #######################################
--------------------This program control the complete process of buying a beverage from a vending Machine.----------------------------

Main software design concepts regarding this application:

The vending machine is designed to enable a user to select what type of hot drink they want. They select one of them each time by choosing a number related to the hot drinks. After selecting the hot drinks, the user has the option to choose if they want to add extra milk or add more sugar. After going to the options the program will let the user know that is hot drink is good to go.

This program can be extended in the future by adding the brew process when the user choose what type of hot drink they want, and also it will be able to be added new type of drink/ and their brew process plus the functionality for user to pay for their hot drinks, without causing any problem to the program it self.

The program can be easily understandable by intended audience. I avoided duplicated code by using subclasses that incorporate structure and behavior of a base class.
